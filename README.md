# University Data Analysis with PCA
Welcome to the University Data Analysis with PCA project! This repository provides an example implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to a university dataset. The project demonstrates how PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization, allowing you to identify patterns and relationships among the dataset's features.

Features
PCA Algorithm: Implementation of Principal Component Analysis for data reduction and feature extraction.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and normalization to prepare the dataset for PCA.
Data Visualization: Visualization of data in reduced dimensions using scatter plots and other charts.
Configurable Parameters: Choose the number of principal components to retain and other parameters through command line arguments.


Dataset
The provided university dataset (universities.csv) includes features such as location, student enrollment, graduation rates, and other factors. This dataset is used as an example for PCA analysis, but you can use your own dataset by specifying the path to your CSV file in the usage instructions.

Results
The PCA analysis script provides:

Variance Explained: A summary of the variance explained by each principal component.
Visualizations: Scatter plots or other charts showing the data projected into the space of the first two principal components, providing insights into potential patterns and relationships.
